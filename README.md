- Position property was quite helpful in building this web page.
- Properties like margin, font-family, flex, and some border properties are used to build the web page in a proper structure
- This web page is slightly different from others I designed earlier. So, It helped me understand how a website can be built in different ways.
- It took nearly three and half hours to complete this project.
- Website is mobile responsive.
- Below image shows the preview of the project:
